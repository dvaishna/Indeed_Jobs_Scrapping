This project aims to scrape IT job listings from Indeed, a popular job search platform, using web scraping techniques. The scraped data includes details such as job title, company name, location, work mode (remote/in-person/hybrid), Experience, and Salary. The goal is to gather relevant information about IT job opportunities available on Indeed and provide a structured dataset for further analysis. The process involves web scraping to gather data, data cleaning to ensure quality, and data visualization to derive meaningful insights. The pipeline is designed to provide users with a seamless experience in exploring and understanding the IT job market.
